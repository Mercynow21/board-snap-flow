Phase 1 — Project Setup & Prototype
- [x] Scaffold project
- [x] Create Vite + React + TypeScript app
- [x] Configure absolute imports / tsconfig paths
- [x] Add environment handling for VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- [x] Install dependencies
- [x] @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/modifiers
- [x] UI: choose one (Tailwind or Mantine). If Tailwind: add PostCSS/Autoprefixer, base config.
- [x] Utility: uuid (if generating IDs client-side)
- [x] @supabase/supabase-js
- [x] App layout skeleton
- [x] Header with project name
- [x] Board wrapper with horizontally scrollable columns
- [x] Column component: header + list + “Add card” input/button
- [x] Card component: compact, single-line title, ellipsis overflow
- [x] Drag & drop prototype (local state only)
- [x] Implement DndContext, sensors (pointer + keyboard)
- [x] Make cards sortable within a column (SortableContext, verticalListSortingStrategy)
- [x] Enable cross-column movement (update columnId + reindex positions)
- [x] Smooth animations & drop transitions
- [x] **Definition of Done (Phase 1)**
- [x] Cards can be reordered within/between default columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) in local state
- [x] No backend calls yet; refresh loses state
- [x] Basic responsive layout and readable typography
Phase 2 — Supabase Project & Database
- [x] Create Supabase project
- [x] Note URL and anon key; add to .env.local
- [x] Database schema
- [x] columns table: id (uuid, pk), title text, position int
- [x] cards table: id (uuid, pk), column_id uuid fk, title text, position int
- [x] Seed default columns with positions 0,1,2
- [x] RLS & Policies
- [x] Enable RLS
- [x] Create permissive read/write policies for anon (public app)
- [x] Supabase client
- [x] Initialize singleton client in frontend
- [x] **Definition of Done (Phase 2)**
- [x] Tables exist with seed data
- [x] Fetching from Supabase with a quick test works (e.g., console log)
Phase 3 — Data Loading & Persistence (MVP)
- [x] Load board on startup
- [x] Fetch columns ordered by position
- [x] Fetch cards ordered by position per column
- [x] Normalize into in-memory state
- [x] Create operations
- [x] Add card: insert with column_id, position = last + 1, title
- [x] Add column: insert with position = last + 1, title
- [x] Update operations
- [x] Edit card title: in-place input; auto-save on blur/Enter
- [x] Reorder cards within a column: persist reordered position
- [x] Move card across columns: update column_id and reindex positions in both affected columns
- [x] Delete operations (cards)
- [x] Delete card from UI and DB; reindex remaining positions
- [x] Optimistic UI + Error handling
- [x] Optimistically update local state; rollback on failure
- [x] Global toast/inline error state
- [x] **Definition of Done (Phase 3)**
- [x] Refreshing the page preserves all changes
- [x] Adding, editing, deleting, reordering, and cross-column moves persist in Supabase
Phase 4 — Column Management (Advanced Functionality)
- [x] Rename columns
- [x] In-place edit for column title; auto-save on blur/Enter
- [x] Reorder columns (optional but recommended)
- [x] Make columns sortable horizontally; persist position
- [x] Delete columns
- [x] Confirm dialog (warn that cards in the column will also be deleted)
- [x] Cascade delete: either DB FK ON DELETE CASCADE or manual delete cards then column
- [x] Reindex remaining column positions
- [x] **Definition of Done (Phase 4)**
- [x] Columns can be added, renamed, reordered, and deleted with persistence
- [x] Cards follow column deletes appropriately
Phase 5 — UX Polish & Accessibility
- [x] Editing UX
- [x] Enter commits; Escape cancels; blur commits
- [x] Auto-focus new card/column inputs
- [ ] DND affordances
- [ ] Drag overlay preview
- [ ] Drop indicators (subtle)
- [ ] Empty states
- [ ] Show guidance when no columns/cards exist
- [x] Keyboard support
- [x] Tab/Enter for adding items
- [x] Keyboard dragging via dnd-kit sensors if feasible
- [x] Responsiveness
- [x] Columns wrap/scroll nicely on small screens
- [ ] **Definition of Done (Phase 5)**
- [ ] Smooth, predictable interactions with clear feedback and no layout jank
Phase 6 — Quality, Tooling, and Delivery
- [x] Type safety & state management
- [x] Define Column, Card types
- [x] Utilities for stable reindexing after moves
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for position/reindex utilities
- [ ] Integration test for add/move across columns logic
- [x] Performance
- [x] Avoid excessive network calls (batch updates on drop)
- [ ] Indexes: (position) and FKs for faster queries
- [x] DevEx
- [x] Prettier + ESLint (TypeScript/React rules)
- [ ] Simple CI lint/test
- [ ] Deploy
- [ ] Environment variables on host (e.g., Netlify/Vercel)
- [ ] Smoke test against production DB
- [ ] **Definition of Done (Phase 6)**
- [ ] Tests pass; deployment live with correct env and basic monitoring/logging.
